# AskSnap – LLM-Based Info Explorer

AskSnap is a lightweight command-line assistant powered by OpenAI's API, designed to help users access structured, focused responses without needing to phrase long or precise questions.

The tool is ideal for exploring technical or unfamiliar topics through summaries and key insights generated by a large language model (LLM).
